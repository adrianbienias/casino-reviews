## Styling

I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

License: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/master/LICENSE

- It makes the CSS bundle as small as possible (only actual used CSS classes are bundled without duplications)
- Naming own CSS classes isn't a thing any more
- It makes the design easily very consistent (no need to use rems/pixels)
- By design it encourages to build small reusable components
